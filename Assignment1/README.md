# Assignment 1

For this project I had to develop a few functions and classes that were capable of a few tasks. These involved reading a text file 
consisting of an image made of ASCII characters, framing these images, and selecting or showing a single image from a pair of images.
The base code was provided and I wrote the parts of the code marked with TODO.
